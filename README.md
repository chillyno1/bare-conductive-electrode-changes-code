# bare-conductive-electrode-changes-code
I am new to this but I am trying to find a code which changes the main MPR121 touch point electrodes on my bare conductive touch board. Any ideas of the the code change?

I am doing a project which uses conductive ink to be touched and allow sound and LED to work together. 
My issue is that I need to use the spare electrodes to do this to allow the output for the LEDs, when activated by the main electrodes.

A code is needed to replace the main electrodes with the new ones.
Do I need to change the MPR.121.pinmode(4, output); code to allow me to use the other electrodes?

I will say that I am using a bredboard to connect one of the electrodes via wires and attaching a LED. I cannot get the LED to blink with this code. Any ideas?
